### Week 1
- I setup our workflow on Jira so that we can be more organnised as to how we handle tickets in the future
- I worked on the epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria for the "Provider" with the rest of the team to produce a concise and detailed ticket for our project
- I added my epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria onto the Jira board, so that we can prepare for our first sprint 

### Week 2
- I discussed the epics, user stories and acceptance criteria for the "Provider" to prepare a final version which we would be using
- I transferred the epics (As Epics), user stories (As user stories under a single Epic) and acceptance criteria (As tasks linked to a user story) under Jira
- I began work on the storyboards for the "Provider" pages on the webapp

### Week 3
- I continued work on the storyboards, and talked about my designs with the rest of the team
- I prepared the flowcharts of my storyboards and sent it to scrum master for final review
