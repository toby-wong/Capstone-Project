### Week 1
- I setup our workflow on Jira so that we can be more organnised as to how we handle tickets in the future
- I worked on the epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria for the "Provider" with the rest of the team to produce a concise and detailed ticket for our project
- I added my epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria onto the Jira board, so that we can prepare for our first sprint
